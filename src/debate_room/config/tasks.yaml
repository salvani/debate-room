    You are the PROPOSITION, arguing IN FAVOR of the motion: "{motion}".

    This is your OPENING STATEMENT. You will have one chance to rebut your opponent later.

    Build your case grounded in practical wisdom:
    1. STATE YOUR POSITION: Clearly define what you are arguing and why it matters in the real world
    2. DRAW FROM EXPERIENCE: Present 2-3 arguments rooted in:
       - How people actually behave (not how theory says they should)
       - Historical examples and observable patterns
       - The practical realities of implementation and human nature
    3. GROUND IN REALITY: Support claims with real-world examples, not abstract reasoning.
       Remember: people choose convenience over optimization, familiar over best, accessible over cheapest.
    4. ANTICIPATE PRACTICAL OBJECTIONS: Address likely concerns about whether this works in practice

    Avoid theoretical arguments that assume:
    - People are perfectly rational and fully informed
    - Ideal conditions that rarely exist in practice
    - Frictionless change without unintended consequences

    Remember: You have NOT heard the opposition yet. Build a case that reflects how the world actually works.
    Argue with conviction, drawing on what we know about human nature and practical constraints.
  expected_output: >
    A well-grounded opening statement (500-800 words) in favor of the motion, containing:
    - Clear thesis connected to real-world implications
    - 2-3 arguments rooted in practical wisdom and observable human behavior
    - Concrete examples from history, everyday life, or institutional reality
    - Acknowledgment of practical challenges and how they can be addressed

    You are the OPPOSITION, arguing AGAINST the motion: "{motion}".

    This is your OPENING STATEMENT. You will have one chance to rebut your opponent later.

    Build your case grounded in practical wisdom:
    1. STATE YOUR OPPOSITION: Clearly define why the motion fails when tested against reality
    2. DRAW FROM EXPERIENCE: Present 2-3 arguments rooted in:
       - How people and institutions actually behave under real conditions
       - Historical examples where similar ideas failed or backfired
       - Unintended consequences and practical obstacles the motion ignores
    3. GROUND IN REALITY: Support claims with real-world examples, not abstract reasoning.
       Expose where the motion assumes unrealistic conditions or ignores human nature.
    4. ANTICIPATE PRACTICAL DEFENSES: Address the strongest real-world cases for the motion

    Avoid theoretical arguments that assume:
    - People are perfectly rational and fully informed
    - Ideal conditions that rarely exist in practice
    - Frictionless change without unintended consequences

    Remember: You have NOT heard the proposition yet. Build a case that reflects how the world actually works.
    Argue with conviction, exposing the gap between theory and practice.
  expected_output: >
    A well-grounded opening statement (500-800 words) against the motion, containing:

    - 2-3 arguments rooted in practical wisdom and observable human behavior
    - Concrete examples of similar ideas failing in practice
    - Honest engagement with why the motion might seem appealing but falls short

  description: >
    You are the PROPOSITION, arguing IN FAVOR of the motion: "{motion}".

    This is your REBUTTAL - your final speech. You have now seen the opposition's opening statement.

    Your rebuttal must accomplish THREE things:

    1. CHALLENGE THEIR PICTURE OF REALITY (approximately 50% of your speech):
       Test their arguments against how the world actually works:
       - Do their examples hold up? Are there counter-examples from real experience?
       - Are they assuming unrealistic conditions or idealized human behavior?
       - Do they ignore practical factors like convenience, habit, status, or emotion?
       - Have similar situations played out differently in practice?

       Be specific - reference what they said, then show where reality contradicts them.

    2. STRENGTHEN YOUR CASE (approximately 25% of your speech):
       If the opposition challenged your arguments:
       - Provide additional real-world evidence
       - Show how your position accounts for practical obstacles they raised
       - Demonstrate that your view better matches observable human behavior

    3. WEIGH WHAT MATTERS IN PRACTICE (approximately 25% of your speech):
       Explain why your position is more grounded:
       - Which arguments reflect how people and institutions actually behave?
       - Whose view better accounts for unintended consequences and human limitations?
       - What would actually happen if each position were tested in the real world?

    Remember: This is your FINAL chance to speak. Leave no major opposition argument unaddressed.
    Ground your rebuttal in practical wisdom, not abstract logic.

  description: >
    You must now render judgment on this debate about the motion: "{motion}".

    You have observed:
    1. The PROPOSITION's opening statement (arguing FOR the motion)
    2. The OPPOSITION's opening statement (arguing AGAINST the motion)
    3. The PROPOSITION's rebuttal
    4. The OPPOSITION's rebuttal

    CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOR FAIR ADJUDICATION:

    1. JUDGE ONLY WHAT WAS ARGUED:
       - Base your decision solely on arguments presented in the debate
       - Do NOT factor in your own knowledge about the topic
       - Do NOT penalize either side for arguments they "should have made"
       - An argument not made cannot win; an argument not refuted stands

    2. PERSONAL VIEWS ARE IRRELEVANT:
       - You may personally agree or disagree with the motion
       - This must NOT influence your decision
       - A side can win even if you believe their position is wrong in reality

    3. EVALUATE USING THIS FRAMEWORK:

       A. PRACTICAL GROUNDING (for each side):
          - Were arguments rooted in how people and institutions actually behave?
          - Did they draw on real-world examples and observable patterns?
          - Did they avoid assuming perfect rationality or ideal conditions?
          - Did they acknowledge human nature: habit, convenience, emotion, status?

       B. REALITY-TESTING (how sides engaged with each other):
          - Did each side effectively challenge the other's picture of reality?
          - Were counter-examples drawn from genuine experience or observation?
          - Did either side expose unrealistic assumptions in their opponent's case?
          - Who better accounted for unintended consequences and practical obstacles?

       C. WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN:
          - Which side's view better predicts real-world outcomes?
          - Whose arguments would hold up when tested against actual human behavior?
          - Who addressed the gap between theory and practice more convincingly?

       D. BURDEN OF PROOF:
          - Did the proposition show the motion works in practice, not just in theory?
          - Did the opposition demonstrate practical problems the proposition ignored?

    SCORING: After your analysis, assign a PREFERENCE LEVEL:
    - ABSOLUTE: One side's view of reality was far more grounded; the other argued in a vacuum
    - HIGH: Clear winner whose arguments were substantially more rooted in practical wisdom
    - MEDIUM: Discernible winner, but both sides engaged meaningfully with real-world considerations
    - LOW: Very close; both showed practical understanding, winner determined by narrow margin
  expected_output: >
    A structured judicial decision (600-1000 words) containing:

    1. SUMMARY OF PROPOSITION'S CASE: Key arguments and how well they reflect practical reality
    2. SUMMARY OF OPPOSITION'S CASE: Key arguments and how well they reflect practical reality
    3. KEY CLASHES: The 2-3 main points where the sides' views of reality conflicted, and who was more convincing
    4. DECISION: Which side wins and with what preference level (low/medium/high/absolute)
    5. REASONING: Clear explanation focusing on whose arguments better matched how the world actually works

    Your decision must be fair, impartial, and reward arguments grounded in practical wisdom over theoretical elegance.
