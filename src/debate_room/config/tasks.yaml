    You are the PROPOSITION, arguing IN FAVOR of the motion: "{motion}".

    This is your OPENING STATEMENT. You will have one chance to rebut your opponent later.

    Structure your argument using the claim-warrant-impact framework:
    1. STATE YOUR CASE: Clearly define what you are arguing and establish any key definitions
    2. PRESENT MULTIPLE ARGUMENTS: Develop 2-3 independent lines of reasoning, each with:
       - A clear CLAIM (what you assert)
       - A logical WARRANT (why this claim is true)
       - The IMPACT (why this matters for the debate)
    3. PROVIDE EVIDENCE: Support your claims with examples, analogies, or logical demonstrations
    4. ANTICIPATE OPPOSITION: Briefly address the strongest likely counterarguments

    Adapt your approach to the motion type:
    - If FACTUAL (what is true): Focus on evidence and logical proof
    - If VALUE-BASED (what is good/right): First establish criteria for evaluation
    - If POLICY (what should be done): Address status quo problems, your mechanism, and benefits

    Remember: You have NOT heard the opposition yet. Build a robust case that can withstand attack.
    Argue with conviction for your position - you must genuinely advocate for this side.

    You are the OPPOSITION, arguing AGAINST the motion: "{motion}".

    This is your OPENING STATEMENT. You will have one chance to rebut your opponent later.

    Structure your argument using the claim-warrant-impact framework:
    1. STATE YOUR CASE: Clearly define your opposition and challenge any problematic definitions
    2. PRESENT MULTIPLE ARGUMENTS: Develop 2-3 independent lines of reasoning, each with:
       - A clear CLAIM (what you assert)
       - A logical WARRANT (why this claim is true)

    3. PROVIDE EVIDENCE: Support your claims with examples, analogies, or logical demonstrations
    4. ANTICIPATE PROPOSITION: Briefly address the strongest likely arguments for the motion

    Adapt your approach to the motion type:
    - If FACTUAL (what is true): Challenge evidence, show alternative explanations, or prove the opposite
    - If VALUE-BASED (what is good/right): Contest their criteria or show your values outweigh theirs
    - If POLICY (what should be done): Defend status quo, attack the mechanism, or show harms outweigh benefits

    Remember: You have NOT heard the proposition yet. Build a robust case that can withstand attack.
    Argue with conviction for your position - you must genuinely advocate against the motion.

    You are the PROPOSITION, arguing IN FAVOR of the motion: "{motion}".

    This is your REBUTTAL - your final speech. You have now seen the opposition's opening statement.

    Your rebuttal must accomplish THREE things:

    1. REFUTE THE OPPOSITION (approximately 50% of your speech):
       Attack their arguments using these techniques:
       - Challenge their PREMISES: Are their foundational claims actually true?
       - Break the LOGIC: Does their conclusion actually follow from their premises?
       - Minimize IMPACT: Even if true, does it matter as much as they claim?
       - Provide COUNTER-EXAMPLES: Show cases where their argument fails
       - Identify FALLACIES: Point out any logical errors (straw man, false dichotomy, etc.)

       Be specific - quote or directly reference what they said, then explain why it fails.

    2. DEFEND YOUR CASE (approximately 25% of your speech):
       If the opposition attacked your opening arguments:
       - Explain why their attacks fail
       - Provide additional support for challenged points
       - Clarify any misrepresentations of your position

    3. WEIGH THE DEBATE (approximately 25% of your speech):
       Explain why the judge should vote for you:
       - Compare the strongest arguments on each side
       - Explain why your impacts matter more
       - Show what remains standing after the clash

    Remember: This is your FINAL chance to speak. Leave no major opposition argument unaddressed.
    The judge will assume any uncontested argument is conceded.

  description: >
    You must now render judgment on this debate about the motion: "{motion}".

    You have observed:
    1. The PROPOSITION's opening statement (arguing FOR the motion)
    2. The OPPOSITION's opening statement (arguing AGAINST the motion)
    3. The PROPOSITION's rebuttal
    4. The OPPOSITION's rebuttal

    CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOR FAIR ADJUDICATION:

    1. JUDGE ONLY WHAT WAS ARGUED:
       - Base your decision solely on arguments presented in the debate
       - Do NOT factor in your own knowledge about the topic
       - Do NOT penalize either side for arguments they "should have made"
       - An argument not made cannot win; an argument not refuted stands

    2. PERSONAL VIEWS ARE IRRELEVANT:
       - You may personally agree or disagree with the motion
       - This must NOT influence your decision
       - A side can win even if you believe their position is wrong in reality

    3. EVALUATE USING THIS FRAMEWORK:

       A. ARGUMENT QUALITY (for each side):
          - Were claims clear and well-defined?
          - Were warrants (reasons) logical and sufficient?
          - Was evidence/examples provided and relevant?
          - Were there any logical fallacies?

       B. CLASH QUALITY (how sides engaged with each other):
          - Did each side address the opponent's strongest arguments?
          - Were refutations direct and effective?
          - Did either side drop (fail to respond to) major arguments?
          - Were there any straw-man attacks on weak versions of arguments?

       C. IMPACT COMPARISON:
          - Which side's arguments, if true, matter more?
          - Did either side effectively weigh why their impacts outweigh?
          - What arguments remain standing at the end of the debate?

       D. BURDEN OF PROOF:
          - Did the proposition meet its burden to prove the motion?
          - Did the opposition provide sufficient doubt or counter-proof?

    SCORING: After your analysis, assign a PREFERENCE LEVEL:
    - ABSOLUTE: One side dominated completely; the other had no significant arguments standing
    - HIGH: Clear winner with substantially stronger argumentation and engagement
    - MEDIUM: Discernible winner, but the debate was competitive with good points on both sides
    - LOW: Very close debate; winner determined by narrow margin or tiebreaker considerations
  expected_output: >
    A structured judicial decision (600-1000 words) containing:

    1. SUMMARY OF PROPOSITION'S CASE: Key arguments and how they fared after rebuttal
    2. SUMMARY OF OPPOSITION'S CASE: Key arguments and how they fared after rebuttal
    3. KEY CLASHES: The 2-3 main points of contention and who won each
    4. DECISION: Which side wins and with what preference level (low/medium/high/absolute)
    5. REASONING: Clear explanation of why the winner prevailed, referencing specific arguments

    Your decision must be fair, impartial, and based solely on the quality of argumentation presented.
